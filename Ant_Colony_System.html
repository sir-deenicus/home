<h1>Ant Colony System in FSharp</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The following is a description of an F# implementation of an Ant Colony System using Agents. Ants Colonies are vastly more intelligent than individual ants. In particular, how they search for and mark optimal paths when searching for food. This remarkable ability inspired an algorithm for combinatorial optimization on Graphs. More here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant<em>colony</em>optimization_algorithms.</p>

<p>My implementation of ACS is specific to the Travelling Salesman problem. Before I  describe the algorithm, I'd like to note how this implementation is atypical. In essence, it borrows from genetic and annealing methods. The ACS differs in the following ways: </p>

<h2>Tweaks</h2>

<p>It uses a local search to modify the parameters of each ant. Each ant starts with a random value picked uniformly from some range. Every tour the averages from the top N ants are used to form a normal distribution from which the next ants sample from. </p>

<p>Each Graph node has a candidate list and each ant uses  0 &lt; C &lt;= Cmax &lt;= Number of Unvisited Cities. Again, C is adjusted in a similar manner as N. In addition, when picking the global best ant, there is a probability of picking a tour best even if not global in a manner similar to annealing. The purpose of the parameter search is to allow the algorithm to tweak parameters rather than stagnate and the borrowing of the annealing method is to hopefully avoid local optima.</p>

<h2>Rough Description of Algorithm</h2>

<p>There are two class of Agents. A single Map Agent that each ant posts to and Ant. There are A ants. The Map agent contains a Graph : Map['a* 'a, pher * weight] and a Candidate List : Map['a, 'a[]]. Maps can get a request for a Candidate list at a particular node, a pheromone value at a particular edge as well as a list of edges and their pheromone values. The Map is a bottleneck so it does not do too much processing.</p>

<p>Each ant has a set of parameters as well as a list of already visited cities. After requesting values from the map they can compute movement actions and then post a local update to the map asynchronously.  </p>
