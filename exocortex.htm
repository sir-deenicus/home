Licklider. Within his speculative 1960 paper Man-Computer Symbiosis, Licklider outlined his vision that humans and the new technology of computers, if tightly-coupled together, would prove to complement each other\'s strengths to such a degree that many of the pure artificial intelligence systems envisioned at the time by optimistic researchers would prove unnecessary:<br/><br/><small><a href =\'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exocortex\'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exocortex</a></small></div>"];4 [label="<div style=\'width:290px\'>Man-computer symbiosis is a subclass of man-machine systems. There are many man-machine systems. At present, however, there are no man-computer symbioses. The purposes of this paper are to present the concept and, hopefully, to foster the development of man-computer symbiosis by analyzing some problems of interaction between men and computing machines, calling attention to applicable principles of man-machine engineering, and pointing out a few questions to which research answers are needed. The hope is that, in not too many years, human brains and computing machines will be coupled together very tightly, and that the resulting partnership will think as no human brain has ever thought and process data in a way not approached by the information-handling machines we know today.—Man-Computer Symbiosis, J.C.R.

Wikipedia itself is an example, as technological interfaces enable inter-brain co-operation on high-level cognitive tasks. The fulfillment of the initial vision of Licklider and Engelbart suggests that continued development along this path is likely.<br/><br/><small><a href =\'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exocortex\'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exocortex</a></small></div>"];6 [label="Memex - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"];7 [label="<div style=\'width:290px\'>Bush envisioned the memex as a device in which individuals would compress and store all of their books, records, and communications, \'mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility.\' The memex would provide an \'enlarged intimate supplement to one\'s memory\'.[<br/><br/><small><a href =\'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex\'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex</a></small></div>"];8 [label="<div style=\'width:290px\'>In \'As We May Think,\' Bush describes a memex as an electromechanical device enabling individuals to develop and read a large self-contained research library, create and follow associative trails of links and personal annotations, and recall these trails at any time to share them with other researchers.

Take, for instance, any popular book of problems and puzzles. Almost every one can be reduced to the form: out of a certain set, indicate one element. ... It is, in fact, difficult to think of a problem, either playful or serious, that does not ultimately require an appropriate selection as necessary and sufficient for its solution.It is also clear that many of the tests used for measuring \'intelligence\' are scored essentially according to the candidate\'s power of appropriate selection. ... Thus it is not impossible that what is commonly referred to as \'intellectual power\' may be equivalent to \'power of appropriate selection\'. Indeed, if a talking Black Box were to show high power of appropriate selection in such matters — so that, when given difficult problems it persistently gave correct answers — we could hardly deny that it was showing the \'behavioral\' equivalent of \'high intelligence\'.If this is so, and as we know that power of selection can be amplified, it seems to follow that intellectual power, like physical power, can be amplified. Let no one say that it cannot be done, for the gene-patterns do it every time they form a brain that grows up to be something better than the gene-pattern could have specified in detail.
