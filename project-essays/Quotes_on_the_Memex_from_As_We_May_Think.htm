<h1>Quotes on the Memex from As We May Think</h1>

<p>Thursday, January 02, 2014 - 11:50 PM</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For years inventions have extended mans physical powers rather than the powers of his mind.
Those who conscientiously attempt to keep abreast of current thought, even in restricted fields, by close and continuous reading might well shy away from an examination calculated to show how much of the previous month's efforts could be produced on call. Mendel's concept of the laws of genetics was lost to the world for a generation because his publication did not reach the few who were capable of grasping and extending it; and this sort of catastrophe is undoubtedly being repeated all about us, as truly significant attainments become lost in the mass of the inconsequential.</p>
</blockquote>

<br/>

<blockquote>
  <p>The difficulty seems to be, not so much that we publish unduly in view of the extent and variety of present day interests, but rather that publication has been extended far beyond our present ability to make real use of the record. The summation of human experience is being expanded at a prodigious rate, and the means we use for threading through the consequent maze to the momentarily important item is the same as was used in the days of square-rigged ships.</p>
</blockquote>

<br/>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the human race has produced since the invention of movable type a total record, in the form of magazines, newspapers, books, tracts, advertising blurbs, correspondence, having a volume corresponding to a billion books, the whole affair, assembled and compressed, could be lugged off in a moving van. Mere compression, of course, is not enough; one needs not only to make and store a record but also be able to consult it, and this aspect of the matter comes late
Even the modern great encyclopedia is not generally consulted; it is nibbled at by a few.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our ineptitude in getting at our data is largely caused by the artificiality of systems of indexing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When data of any sort are placed in storage, they are filed alphabetically or chronologically, and information is found (when it is) by tracing it down from directory to directory [<em>or, in the case of the internet, page to page</em>]. It can be in only one place, unless duplicates are used; one has to have rules as to which path will locate it, and the rules are cumbersome. Having found one item, moreover, one has to emerge from the system and re-enter on a new path. The human mind does not work that way.</p>
</blockquote>

<br>

<blockquote>
  <p>It operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain. It has other characteristics, of course; trails that are not frequently followed are prone to fade, items are not fully permanent, memory is transitory. Yet the speed of action, the intricacy of trails, the detail of mental pictures, is awe-inspiring beyond all else in nature.</p>
</blockquote>

<br>

<blockquote>
  <p>In minor ways he may even improve, for his records have relative permanency. The first idea, however, to be drawn from the analogy concerns selection. Selection by association, rather than indexing, may yet be mechanized. One cannot hope thus to equal the speed and flexibility with which the mind follows an associative trail, but it should be possible to beat the mind decisively in regard to the permanence and clarity of the items resurrected from storage.</p>
</blockquote>

<br>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consider a future device for individual use, which is a sort of mechanized private file and library. It needs a name, and, to coin one at random, "memex" will do. A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.</p>
</blockquote>

<br>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any given book of his library can thus be called up and consulted with far greater facility than if it were taken from a shelf. Selection by association, rather than indexing, may yet be mechanized. One cannot hope thus to equal the speed and flexibility with which the mind follows an associative trail, but it should be possible to beat the mind decisively in regard to the permanence and clarity of the items resurrected from storage.</p>
</blockquote>

<br>

<blockquote>
  <p>It affords an immediate step, however, to associative indexing, the basic idea of which is a provision whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another</p>
