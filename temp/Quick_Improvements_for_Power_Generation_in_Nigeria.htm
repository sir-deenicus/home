<h1>Quick Improvements for Power Generation in Nigeria</h1>

<p>Within Nigeria, lack of power is a major problem both for industry and for quality of life in general. There are difficult problems that require large infrastructural changes such as better and more transmission capability, more generation, generally a better grid and tracking and monitoring of equipment. But even within those constraints much can be done to improve customer satisfaction as well as more efficient deployment of revenue.</p>

<p>The use of data and prediction can help with making significant improvements quickly even with all the constraints from poor infrastructure.</p>

<h3>Scheduling</h3>

<p>If outages were more deterministic, then businesses could plan around them and minimize spend on fuel. Even psychologically, resolving the lack of certainty would have a positive effect on stress for both homes and businesses. This would improve customer satisfaction and make people more willing to cooperate.</p>

<p>High poverty areas also have the least load. Optimization to schedule allocation such that high wealth and high load areas get good coverage but also maximizing for both rich and poor regions is one use of algorithms plus data. Data can also be use to estimate theft and areas of loss; with better coverage in poor areas people may be more willing to listen to pleas against theft.</p>

<h3>Feedback and Optimization</h3>

<p>Scheduling can also include regional feedback. This could be anything from using geocoded tweets to a custom app. The feedback could then be use within an optimization algorithm which plans when to make outages. Business heavy locations may prioritize day time stability while domestic areas prioritize night time and a balance for mixed areas. The combination of prediction and optimization algorithms can find this optimal balance more quickly and far more effectively than humans.</p>

<p>Furthermore, during outages effective communication and estimated timelines can make a large difference on customer satisfaction. Explaining the cause of a fault and affected areas would be a cost free but much appreciated measure. Historical data can be used to predict expected timelines.</p>

<h2>Demand Forecasting</h2>

<p>Finally, forecasting demand is important regardless of the state and sophistication of energy generation. For example, within Nigeria, better forecasting can improve allocation and reduce costs from improved fuel management.</p>

<h2>Communication with Companies</h2>

<p>Of course, before much work can be done, communicating with power companies to understand their needs, operations and requirements will be important. This will be a business to business operation so the standard advantages (clear monetization via custom alterations to a product) and disadvantages (red tape, bureaucracy, few high paying customers) apply.</p>

<p>Improving the state of power in Nigeria can effect many positive outcomes from industry to the generators themselves and even mental well being of the population.</p>
