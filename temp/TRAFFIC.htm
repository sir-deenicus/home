<h1>TRAFFIC</h1>

<p>Traffic is a major problem all over the world and it is an especially major one in Lagos. Traffic is usually due to repeat causes or uncommon events. Repeat causes include: too many cars, cars driving antagonistically, and poor coordination (e.g. traffic lights which do not adapt to optimize flow). Non repeat causes are accidents, special events, Work zones or Inclement Weather. Addressing the problem of traffic would lead to an immediate and large quality of life improvement for many people.</p>

<h3>1. Tracking Traffic Flow with Image Analysis by Drones</h3>

<p>One idea is to set up drones to monitor traffic flow and then using that data for decision making purposes. Unfortunately, I do not think this approach is ideal.</p>

<h4>Energy</h4>

<p>Drones typically fly by batteries—of which even the best have low energy and power density. This means low flight times and charge times that are long. This necessitates a number of them taking turns per location.</p>

<h4>Sensors</h4>

<p>More task specific sensors to track vehicles exist and can do so with better specificity and granularity.</p>

<h4>Defensibility</h4>

<p>The method to analyze traffic requires hardware at target locations and then suggesting improvements to local government bodies. That business model would revolve around the data and its analysis. There is nothing stopping governments scaling sensing and tracking internally to save money once the idea has been proven.</p>

<h3>2. More and or Wider Roads</h3>

<p>One common idea is to introduce or widen roads. However, due to phenomena such as Braess' paradox, this can just as likely worsen the problem. This is due to people increasing utilization to take advantage of the extra capacity until things return to the old equilibrium of congestion.</p>

<h2>Workable Methods</h2>

<p>Instead of increasing supply, the best methods reduce or shift demand to a more efficient method of travel.</p>

<h3>3. Charging fees at bottlenecks + Public Transportation</h3>

<p>One of the most effective traffic reduction methods is identifying bottlenecks and charging a very small fee for their use. However, a disadvantage is that this privileges those with more disposable income. Thus this method works better in conjunction with alternative methods of travel such as light rail, trains or even trams. Unfortunately, in the context of Nigeria, this method is less feasible due to requiring too much competent cooperation and planning.</p>

<h3>4. Bus, Car pool, Bike Lanes</h3>

<p>Another method that has worked well is to provide good alternatives to car travel. This includes taking profits from road pricing to improve public transportation in the form of buses and special bus lanes. Incentivizing car pooling by offering special lanes and exemption from road pricing and finally pushing for more bike friendly cities. These should all be achievable in a reasonable timespan—even in Lagos.</p>

<h2>Traffic Management via Reporting</h2>

<p>The disadvantage of all prior mentioned attempts at solutions is they require significant government cooperation. Another suite of methods that is immediately applicable to Lagos and Nigeria—without being dependent on government—are those based on the ideas of traffic management and reporting.</p>

<p>The simplest way to address traffic would be the use of an ad-hoc p2p network of phones in vehicles to transmit velocities with driver phones then audibly advising velocities near to the existing average. A slower average might improve flow by reducing the number of abrupt changes (which generate a wave of traffic long after a cause). A longer term goal might be even learning how to optimally adjust velocities per location. The app might also educate users against constant lane changes.</p>

<p>These velocities could also be transmitted to a central server which could be queried by anyone deciding when to take a trip. Past information of average velocities and time for example could inform the driver whether to wait or leave (beyond just alternate routes). For example, if waiting 15 minutes means less traffic, you might get to work at the same time as if you'd left earlier but met with more traffic. This then helps reduce the number of vehicles on road. This could be learned both locally per phone, and globally—with coordination—on the server.</p>

<h4>Monetization</h4>

<p>Monetization of the application could be done via Ads or a Free to use ad-hoc and local learning but paying to access information on the server (perhaps with bulk pricing e.g. 10 Naira w. for 100 lookups). Truthfully however, the likely exit strategy of such an application would be a buyout by some car travel focused large company.</p>

<h4>Downsides</h4>

<p>There are lots of risks to undertaking such a project. Foremost are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The traffic forecasting and information was done by Waze which was purchased by google. This makes Google a competitor. <strong>Differentiation:</strong> is local learning and global coordination to suggest best trip start times (not defensible) and ad-hoc vehicle coordination.</p></li>
<li><p>P2P devices would be limited to people with Android 4+ with appropriate hardware running the app. <strong>Upside:</strong> Not everyone needs to be driving optimally to make a difference on traffic flow.</p></li>
<li><p>Difficulty of the project is very high and has multiple components including: Mapping, P2P, A central server and learning/prediction (local and global).</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Appendix: Uses of Drones in Nigeria</h2>

<p>Although I do not believe drones will have much utility in addressing traffic in comparison to other methods, there are uses to which they could be put to.</p>

<ul>
<li>(e.g.) Agriculture and crop, herd monitoring</li>
<li>infrastructure monitoring (oil , gas; electric grid and poles especially)</li>
<li>Security for homes needing protection from the dangers of wealth inequality</li>
<li>anti poaching</li>
<li>surveying, aerial photography</li>
</ul>
